# Personal-Website

This project is my personal website. It features sections introducing myself as a student and tech enthusiast, showcasing my portfolio with various projects, and providing contact information. The website is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with additional styling from **Bootstrap** and **Font Awesome** for icons. It includes:
- A header with navigation
- An about section highlighting my background and interests
- A portfolio section displaying my projects
- A contact form for visitors to get in touch

The website design is responsive and incorporates **Google Fonts** for typography.
